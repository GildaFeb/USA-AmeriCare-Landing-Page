            I confirm that I am at least 18 years of age.
            <br />
            I acknowledge that all products sold to Madtwin Records LLC must be in their original, unopened packaging and free from any damage. Damage is defined as any condition that compromises the integrity of the box, including but not limited to crushing, bending, tearing, staining, or any other form of soiling.
            <br />
            Prior to resale, Madtwin Records LLC will remove all prescription labels. I understand that any damage caused by label removal, such as tearing, will render the product ineligible for acceptance.
            <br />
            I am responsible for securely packaging my items to prevent damage during transit. Madtwin Records LLC will not accept items that sustain damage during shipment.
            <br />
            Any box with a broken or missing seal will be considered opened and will not be accepted.
            <br />
            All products must have a minimum of six (6) months remaining before expiration at the time of shipment. Items with expiration dates less than two (2) months from the shipping date will not be accepted.
            <br />
            If I send products that are within two months of expiration, have been tampered with, opened, damaged, or otherwise compromised, I acknowledge that these items will be donated on my behalf.
            <br />
            I understand that business checks typically arrive within three business days; however, delivery may take up to two weeks depending on USPS processing times.
            <br />
            I affirm that I am the legal owner of the items being sold to Madtwin Records LLC or have the legal authorization to sell them on behalf of the rightful owner.
            <br />
            I certify that these supplies have been lawfully obtained and that the sale does not violate any applicable laws or regulations. Additionally, I confirm that this transaction will not cause Madtwin Records LLC to violate any legal requirements, including but not limited to anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, and healthcare compliance laws.
            <br />
            The diabetic supplies I am selling have not been reported lost or stolen, and I lawfully possess them. In the event that any items are later determined to be lost or stolen, Madtwin Records LLC reserves the right to reject the transaction and is under no obligation to provide compensation, including reimbursement for shipping costs.
            <br />
            Madtwin Records LLC does not purchase products that have been subsidized by government or insurance programs, including but not limited to Medicare and Medicaid.
            <br />
            By verifying my mobile number, I consent to receiving text message notifications from Madtwin Records LLC. Failure to verify my number will result in not receiving updates regarding mail kit delivery, product receipt, or check issuance.
            <br />
            I understand that Madtwin Records LLC may share my information with marketing partners, affiliates, and third-party service providers.
            <br />
            I acknowledge that the terms and conditions of Madtwin Records LLC may be updated at any time without prior notification. It is my responsibility to review the most current terms, available at https://usamericareteststrips.com/, before each transaction.
            <br />
            I confirm that I will not intentionally acquire diabetic supplies through insurance solely for the purpose of reselling them to Madtwin Records LLC.
            <br />
            I understand that shipping times vary, and while most packages are delivered within one week, some may take up to 14 days.
            <br />
            Madtwin Records LLC, its affiliates, and business partners shall not be held liable for any indirect, consequential, special, punitive, incidental, or exemplary damages—whether foreseeable or unforeseeable—that may arise from this agreement.
